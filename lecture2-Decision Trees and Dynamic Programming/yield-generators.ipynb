    "For the following problem, consider the following way to write a power set generator. The number of possible combinations to put n items into one bag is 2ùëõ. Here, items is a Python list. If need be, also check out the [docs on bitwise operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) (\\<\\<, \\>\\>, &, |, ~, ^).\n",

    "As above, suppose we have a generator that returns every combination of objects in one bag. We can represent this as a list of 1s and 0s denoting whether each item is in the bag or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a generator that returns every arrangement of items such that each is in one or none of two different bags. Each combination should be given as a tuple of two lists, the first being the items in bag1, and the second being the items in bag2.\n",

    "* With one bag we determined there were 2^ùëõ possible combinations available by representing the bag as a list of binary bits, 0 or 1. Since there are N bits, and they can be one of two possibilities, there must be 2^ùëõ possibilities.\n",
    "* With two bags there thus must be 3^ùëõ possible combinations. You can imagine this by representing the two bags as a list of \"trinary\" bits, 0, 1, or 2 (a 0 if an item is in neither bag; 1 if it is in bag1; 2 if it is in bag2). With the \"trinary\" bits, there are N bits that can each be one of three possibilities - thus there must be 3ùëõ possible combinations."
